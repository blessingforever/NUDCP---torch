Primarily used for predicting of the medium transmission map in underwater environments.

# source and difference
The code is translated from the original python version from [https://github.com/wangyanckxx/Enhancement-of-Underwater-Images-with-Statistical-Model-of-BL-and-Optimization-of-TM](URL).

Tensor operations have been changed from NumPy to Torch.
