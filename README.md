# NUDCP---torch
pytorch implementation of NUDCP [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8957276).

Primarily used for predicting of the medium transmission map in underwater environments.

# Source and Difference
The code is translated from the original python version from [Github repository](https://github.com/wangyanckxx/Enhancement-of-Underwater-Images-with-Statistical-Model-of-BL-and-Optimization-of-TM).

Tensor operations have been changed from NumPy to Torch.
